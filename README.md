## Contributing

We welcome contributions from people of all abilities! To make sure that your efforts are not in vain, **please open an issue or ask to be assigned to one** in order to make sure that:

- No one else is working on the feature already, and
- The feature is needed in the first place.

We would be happy to help and provide guidance as needed.

## Use MacOS or Linux for Elixir development

We recommend using MacOS or Linux when programming with Elixir, the developer experience of using Elixir with Windows is [not a positive one](https://elixirforum.com/t/the-elixir-experience-on-windows-is-deteriorating/26538).
If you are a Windows user you will likely find it much easier to dual boot a linux distribution such as Ubuntu than struggle with broken tooling.
